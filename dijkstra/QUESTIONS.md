### 20C - Dijkstra?

You are given a weighted undirected graph. The vertices are enumerated from 1 to n. Your task is to find the shortest path between the vertex 1 and the vertex n.

#### Input

The first line contains two integers n and m, where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges. Following m lines contain one edge each in form ai, bi and wi, where ai andâ€‰bi are edge endpoints, and wi is the length of the edge.

It is possible that the graph has loops and multiple edges between pair of vertices.

#### Output

Write the only integer -1 in case of no path. Write the shortest path in opposite case. If there are many solutions, print any of them.
